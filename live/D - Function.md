Functions are things that take in [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs]], processes them, and produces outputs. 

How something 'functions' is what inputs it takes, how it processes those inputs, and what outputs it produces.

All functions are either a [[D - System|system]] or a [[D - Parameter|parameter]].

[[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|Functions that are able to change itself are systems]] and [[E - All functions in a system are parameters|all functions in a system are parameters]]. 

Functions can contain [[D - Element|elements]] (variables) and other functions. Recursive functions are still parameters (not systems) as they ultimately don't change the way the function itself works.
