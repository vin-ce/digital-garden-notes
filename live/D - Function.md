Functions take in inputs and produces outputs. [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|Functions that are able to change itself are systems]] and [[E - All functions in a system are parameters|all functions in a system are parameters]]. Thus, [[E - Everything that functions is a system or a parameter|everything that functions is a system or a parameter]], or put another way, a function is either a system or a parameter.  

Functions can contain [[D - Element|elements]] (variables) and other functions. Recursive functions are still [[D - Parameter|parameters]] (not [[D - System|systems]]) as they ultimately don't change the way the function itself works.
