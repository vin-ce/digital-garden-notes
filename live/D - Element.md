An element is the 'data' that a [[D - System|system]] (and its parts) work with, or that define it in some way. In the programming sense, they're a primitives[^number, character, boolean etc] and variables (that isn't a function).

Systems can also pass around [[D - Function|functions]] (which are not primitives).

The element is grossly imprecise at the moment.
