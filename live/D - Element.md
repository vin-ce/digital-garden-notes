An element is a primitive (in the programming sense like a number, a character, a boolean etc). They are part of the data that gets [[D - Inputs and Outputs|flown through inputs and produced through outputs]].

[[D - Parameter|Parameters]] define the relationships between primitives either through a static equating or a dynamic, functional equating (x = y through some functional relationship).
