[[D - Simulation|Simulations]] are all about resolution and complexity. When something is just as real as that which it's trying to simulate, then you've created something that's on par with it. Again, this falls into the 'what is considered reality' conversation, but I believe thinking about it in terms of complexity is a good way to start.
