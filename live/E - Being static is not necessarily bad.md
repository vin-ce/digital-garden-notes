We often believe that a [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|static]] viewpoint or institution is bad. 

Consider a person who's 'static' about their beliefs in integrity and 'loving your neighbours', being unwilling to change even in challenging circumstances. 

Consider also order and tradition. They often last because they are time-tested and proven models, e.g the scientific method.

Obviously this does not mean that we should always stick to that which is static.
