A [[D - Function|function]] is truly redundant when the [[D - Inputs and Outputs|outputs]] it produces have absolutely no affect on anything else.  This might happen because:

- It no longer receives the inputs that it works with, resulting from:
	- Inputs having evolved to where it no longer operates within that function (e.g people no longer communicate through morse code) or
	- Some other function has taken over the role (e.g Zoom is used instead).
- The output it produces is inconsequential as it's irrelevant to the system's operation
