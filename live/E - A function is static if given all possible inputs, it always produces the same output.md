If a [[D - Function|function]] is fed an infinite amount of possibilities and it always produces the same thing, then it's a function that's unchanging and does not respond to the input, making it static. 

For something to be dynamic, it must have the ability to [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|produce different outputs given different inputs]]. 

More precisely, it's a matter of ratio: [[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output|restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output]].
