[[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|To be dynamic means that different inputs will eventually produce different outputs]], as [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|static things only produce one output]]. This doesn't mean all different inputs produce different outputs - I like to think of it as ratios (see *[[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output|Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output]]*). 

Dynamism [[E - Parameters determine a system's dynamism|depends on its parameters]]. [[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs|A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]].

It's important to keep in mind the context in which the appraisal of dynamism is being made.
- A paper in the physical realm is dynamic. It reacts to changes in force. 
- A paper in the space of ideas is not. If ideas are words or drawings, then the paper does not change itself based on the ideas that are being put upon it.
