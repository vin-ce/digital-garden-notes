A dynamic [[D - System|system]] is defined by either one or both features:

1. [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|It has a lot of outputs in response to a lot of inputs]]
2. It can change which outputs it's giving depending on which [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs]] it's receiving. 

For example, a system changing its own outputs through [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|changing]] its [[D - Parameter|parameters]] to interpret the same inputs differently, depending on context attached to the inputs, e.g throughout time, the system adjusts to the same, fundamental needs in different ways to better suit the era.

The above example could be seen as static within a narrow slice of time, e.g feudalism is the only hierarchy structure that exists. But, broadening out our scope, we see that we're actually dynamic beings capable of producing many different structures to resolve the same basic issues.
