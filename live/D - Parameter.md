# Parameter

Parameters are functions that can take [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs and outputs]].

[[E - All functions in a system are parameters]], [[E - All parameters are functional]] and [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates]]. 

As parameters are functions, parameters can also be  [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|functions can be static]]. [[E - Dynamism consists of dynamic parameters]], and dynamic parameters [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|can produce different outputs given different inputs]].

A parameter which makes a [[D - System|system]] a system is one in which its output can [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|change]] either how the parameter itself or how other parameters in the system functions. This is incredibly powerful as it provides a way to fundamentally change and evolve itself. [[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]].

A parameter can be a [[D - System]].

*Reasoning for archiving*

Parameters simply define what can exist and what can't exist. A system (as is a universe, which is a system) consists of parameters and primitives which fulfill the rules of the parameters. A primitive cannot exist within a system if it does not conform to the system's rules. 

Defining what can exist within the realm of a system is the job of the parameters, but the actual elements that exist within it are not parameters themselves.

Parameters can either be a function or an element, and so they take *D - Inputs and Outputs| **inputs and outputs***.

- A parameter is either elemental or functional (with less accuracy, static or dynamic).
	- An elemental parameter is a definition of primitive (*D - Element| **element***) relationships.

- x = 5
	- This is a static element definition that defines the relationship between x and 5. It is *not* a function, as there is no input/ output- it is a direct definition with no change, a 'primitive' that is equated between one another.
