Parameters are functions that can take [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs and outputs]].

[[E - All functions in a system are parameters|All functions in a system are parameters]], [[E - All parameters are functional|all parameters are functional]] and [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|parameters determine how a system operates]]. 

A parameter which makes a [[D - System|system]] a system is one in which its output can [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|change]] either how the parameter itself or how other parameters in the system functions (which inputs it takes in, how it processes that input and which resulting outputs are generated), allowing the system [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|to change itself]].

As parameters are functions, parameters can be [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|static]] or dynamic ([[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|producing different outputs given different inputs]]). [[E - Dynamism consists of dynamic parameters|Something that's dynamic consists of dynamic parameters]].

A parameter can be a [[D - System|system]].
