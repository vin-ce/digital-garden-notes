# System

[[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|Systems are functions that can change itself]]. [[D - Function|Functions]] operate solely on non-self changing input/ output. 

A system is defined by its:
- [[D - Parameter|Parameters]] 
	- [[E - All functions in a system are parameters|all functions in a system are parameters]] and [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|parameters determine how a system operates]]. 
- [[D - Element|Elements]]. 

Everything within a system can shift ([[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs|A dynamic system can be one which is able to change its outputs]]). After all, that is what makes it a system. However, [[E - A system can be static|a system can be static]] too.
