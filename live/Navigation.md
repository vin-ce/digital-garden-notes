This is a digital garden first found from Andy's stuff.

## Navigating
Tooltips
bi-directional links (linked references)

## Note Types
Below are note types listed in a roughly hierarchical manner.

### MOC
Two types:
1. 'Book titles' type. Linking together multiple concepts + topics + evergreens. Holistic thought, 'publishable' as article.
2. Topic type. A direct field such as [[0201 Stoicism MOC| stoicism]].

### Evergreens
Notion page on Andy's explanation of [evergreen notes.](https://www.notion.so/Evergreen-Notes-37c323295bfd447f9f193caa8f9967bb)
Mine will also keep a history of major thought changes. 

### Type Prefixes
Inspired by [Maggie Appleton's page prefixes](https://maggieappleton.com/roam-garden), I've created my own, which you might see crop up from time to time. 

- **A - Articles**
- **B - Books**
	- Long-form notes -> (per chapter) evergreens/ definitions -> MOCs generated from those evergreens
- **C - Courses**
- **D - Definitions**
	- Definitions/ Concepts that aren't quite MOCs
- **E - Evergreens**
	- E_Q - Evergreen Questions, evolved from really good #Q's 


## Technical
This is built on [Gatsby](gatsbyjs.com/), and is my first project using it. I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far!

Folder in Obsidian, public git, pulled from there as pages, parsed through custom plugin that turns double bracket links into proper ones.
