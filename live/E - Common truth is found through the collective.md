"Common" is used in the sense of [[D - Common Reality|common reality]] here. Bit of an obvious statement, but things like science is established on the basis of collective judgement and belief. 

If everyone agrees that something is true, whether or not it is actually 'cosmically' [[Truth MOC|true]], it becomes the truth for us. Reason doesn't help us reach undeniable 'truths', but gives us consensus as to how the largest amount of people are able to reach the same conclusion.

What we deem real does often has to be checked with disconnected others as evidence of our own version.
