Things like science is established on the basis of collective judgement and belief. 

"Common" is used in the sense of [[D - Common Reality|common reality]]. If everyone agrees that something is true, regardless of its 'cosmic' [[Truth MOC|truth]] or [[D - Full Reality|fullness of reality]], it becomes the truth for us. 

Reason doesn't help us reach undeniable 'truths', but gives our most reliable method for having the largest amount of people reach the same conclusions.

What we deem real often has to be checked with disconnected others as evidence of our own version.
