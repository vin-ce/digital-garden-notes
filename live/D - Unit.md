A unit is a collection of [[D - System|systems]] that form a stable part of a larger system (such as a city). 

A unit itself could be thought of as a [[E - A system can be static|static system]] as it's something fixed, making it an identifiable feature that defines something like a city. 

Units are never stand-alone entities that aren't either directly part of a system or a [[D - Parameter|parameter]]: [[E - Everything stands in relation to everything else|everything stands in relation to everything else]].
