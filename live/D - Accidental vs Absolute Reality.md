There are two kinds of reality[^from Kosho Uchiyama's Opening the Hand of Thought] :

## Accidental/ Chance
Examples: 
- I'm pouring myself tea. 
- I'm born in a certain country, in a certain time period, to certain parents etc.

There's no absolute, cosmic reason why these facts are so, making them 'accidental'.


## Absolute/ Undeniable 
Things that happen in all versions and permutations, that don't change with any resistance, opposition, or denial.

Example:
All living things die.
