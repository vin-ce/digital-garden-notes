The Systems, Parameters, Inputs + Outputs (SPIO) model is a self-concocted, super rudimentary model of how the world functions. It was spurred by trying to figure out what exactly makes a medium 'dynamic' (while parsing back through the notes for [[A - Personal Dynamic Medium|Personal Dynamic Medium]]), which then necessitated a bunch of other base level concepts and interactions.

I happened to be in a head space of thinking about systems as I had just read [[A - A City is Not a Tree|A City is Not a Tree]], listened to [[Joscha Bach]]'s chat with [[Lex Fridman]] and was in the deep of programming things.

A lot of the writing feels quite hard to understand - this is due to poor prose and a desire to robustly define some concept. For me, seeing how the concepts are mapped onto/ interprets/ explains higher level things is where it becomes useful and interesting. It's not necessarily accurate, but, for me, is a helpful frame of mind to understand things.

The SPIO Workbench of Ideas collect just such higher-level interpretations. I have yet to start converting them into notes. 

## Core Definitions
- [[D - Inputs and Outputs]]
- [[D - System|System]]
- [[D - Parameter]]

- [[D - Element]]
- [[D - Function]]

- [[E - Everything that functions is a system or a parameter]]
- [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself]]
- [[E - All functions in a system are parameters]]

### Additional Elements
- [[D - Unit]]
- [[D - Structure]]
- [[D - Tree]]
- [[D - Semilattice]]

- [[D - Tree vs Semilattice]]

## Dynamic
- [[D - Dynamism]]

- [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs]]
- [[E - Parameters determine dynamism]]
- [[E - Dynamism consists of dynamic parameters]]
- [[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]]

- [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion]]

## Static
- [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output]]
- [[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output]]
- [[E - A system can be static]]
- [[E - Cyclical things are static]]
- [[E - Dynamic parts don't make a dynamic system]]
- [[E - Being static is not necessarily bad]]

## Functioning / Redundancy
- [[E - Functions are redundant when its output has no consequence]]
- [[E - Truly redundant things are invisible]]
- [[E - Functional things have meaningful output]]
- [[E - All parameters are functional]]

## Misc
- [[E - Systems are ways to deal with inputs]]
