The Systems, Parameters, Inputs + Outputs (SPIO) model is a self-concocted, super rudimentary model of how the world functions. It was spurred by trying to figure out what exactly makes a medium 'dynamic' (while parsing back through the notes for [[A - Personal Dynamic Medium|Personal Dynamic Medium]]), which then necessitated a bunch of other base level concepts and interactions.

I happened to be in a head space of thinking about systems as I just read [[A - A City is Not a Tree|A City is Not a Tree]], as well as recently having listened to [[Joscha Bach]]'s chat with [[Lex Fridman]].
