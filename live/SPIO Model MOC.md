The Systems, Parameters, Inputs + Outputs (SPIO) model is a self-concocted, super rudimentary model of how the world functions. It was spurred by trying to figure out what exactly makes a medium 'dynamic'[^while parsing through the notes for Personal Dynamic Medium], which then necessitated a bunch of other base level concepts and interactions.

I happened to be in a head space of thinking about systems as I had just read [[A - A City is Not a Tree|A City is Not a Tree]], listened to [[Joscha Bach]]'s chat with [[Lex Fridman]] and was in the deep of programming things.

The overview covers the primary ideas and do not provide real-world examples. The notes (sometimes) do. The *SPIO Workbench of Ideas* collects concepts interpreted through SPIO. I will include them in the overview once they are converted into notes.

### Overview

The world is made up of [[D - System|systems]]. Systems are [[D - Function|functions]], which are things that take in [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs]], manipulate them in some way to then produce outputs. 

Systems are made up of [[D - Parameter|parameters]] ([[E - All functions in a system are parameters|which are functions too]]) and [[D - Element|elements]]. What makes a system special is that [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|they can change themselves]] through their own parameters.

What makes a system (or anything) [[D - Dynamism|dynamic]] is that it [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|different inputs produce different outputs]], and/ or the system can [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|change]] its own parameters such that the *same* inputs [[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs|create different outputs]]. What makes a system dynamic also depends [[E - Parameters determine a system's dynamism|on its parameters]] (although [[E - Dynamic parts don't make a dynamic system|it dynamic parts don't always make a dynamic system]]).

[[E - A system can be static|A system can be static]] too if it [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|always produces the same output even if you give it a bunch of different inputs]]. This includes things that are [[E - Cyclical things are static|cyclical]]. [[E - Being static is not necessarily bad|Being static is not necessarily bad]] - it depends on *what* the static thing is.

More broadly, whether something is dynamic or not is a subjective matter as it's dependent on [[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output|the ratio of input to output]].

When we talk about something as redundant, it's not redundant, as [[E - Functions are redundant when its output has no consequence|redundant things have no consequence]] (good or bad). This makes them [[E - Truly redundant things are invisible|invisible]]. 

This means that [[E - Functional things have meaningful output|functional things have meaningful output]], and that [[E - All parameters are functional|all parameters are therefore functional]].

## Core Definitions

- [[D - Inputs and Outputs]]
- [[D - System|System]]
	- [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself]]
	- [[E - Systems are ways to deal with inputs]]
- [[D - Parameter]]
	- [[E - All functions in a system are parameters]]

- [[D - Function]]
- [[D - Element]]


## Dynamic
- [[D - Dynamism]]

- [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs]]
- [[E - Parameters determine a system's dynamism]]
- [[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]]

- [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion]]

## Static
- [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output]]
- [[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output]]
- [[E - A system can be static]]
- [[E - Cyclical things are static]]
- [[E - Dynamic parts don't make a dynamic system]]
- [[E - Being static is not necessarily bad]]

## Functioning / Redundancy
- [[E - Functions are redundant when its output has no consequence]]
- [[E - Truly redundant things are invisible]]
- [[E - Functional things have meaningful output]]
- [[E - All parameters are functional]]
