> A collection of sets forms a tree if and only if, for any two sets that belong to the collection either one is wholly contained in the other, or else they are wholly disjoint.[^From Christopher Alexander, A City is Not a Tree (ACiNaT)]

A tree is a structure in which one section of a subset is never connected to another section except through the 'medium of that unit as a whole'

It is a [[D - Semilattice|semilattice]] that doesn't overlap.

> The enormity of this restriction is difficult to grasp. It is a little as though the members of a family were not free to make friends outside the family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship.[^ACiNaT]
