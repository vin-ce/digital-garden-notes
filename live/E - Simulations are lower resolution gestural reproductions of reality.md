[[D - Simulation|Simulations]] by definition are recreations of some input reality. 

We can think of 'lower resolution' in two senses:
1. We are unable to perceive what's outside of what we can perceive (thinking in the 4th dimension visually, for example)
2. We don't have access to the full spectrum of what we can perceive. 

In our current state, we are unable to completely recreate reality in all its complexity on a computer, where most simulations happen. In other uses of the term, like 'simulating' a particular scenario or situation, it's still a lower resolution 'mock' version of the real thing (in the second sense). While it's attempting to be as close to it as possible, it is still 'not the real thing', hence a simulation of it. 

It becomes real when all of its elements and complexity is at play, [[E - When a simulation reaches the complexity of that which it's simulating, it transcends onto the same plane of existence|thus graduating being simply a simulation]]. This could be the impact it has on the person doing the simulating etc, although it's heavily debatable. See the definition note in the first line for more discussion.
