Simulations are [[E - Simulations are lower resolution gestural reproductions of reality|lower resolution]] recreations of a reality that either already exists or hasn't been discovered yet. [[E - When a simulation reaches the complexity of that which it's simulating, it transcends onto the same plane of existence|When a simulation reaches the complexity of what it's simulating, it's no longer a simulation as it has transcended onto the same plane of existence]]. 

## Not Yet Discovered
A reality that 'hasn't been discovered yet' means, for example, the sound of a trumpet and piano combined. This fused instrument has not being created yet, but you could engineer the sound waves with software to simulate it. 

## Reaching Common Reality
The reality discussed here can only exist in [[D - Common Reality| common reality]] as [[E - Our mind holds only a simulation of reality| our minds are only capable of recreating a lower resolution]] of [[D - Full Reality|full reality]]. If our simulation reaches common reality, we will deem it to be consistent with full reality.


## What Makes it Real?
What makes something 'real' and no longer a simulation? I suggested that it's when the simulation reaches the same level of complexity as what it's trying to simulate (the target). But what if it's *not* at the same level of complexity, but it's behaviour is indistinguishable from the simulation target?

Just because it's artificially created, does it make it 'less real'? If we can no longer tell AI robots apart from humans, what stops us from deeming it to be as 'real' as us?

If everyone was in VR and there was no difference between VR and [[D - Common Reality|common reality]] (like some Matrix situation), how might we perceive complexity and its role here?

This question ultimately comes down to the opposite of simulation - 'reality'. 
- What do we perceive to ultimately be 'real' and the truth?
