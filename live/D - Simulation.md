Simulations are either recreations of a reality that already exists or one that simply hasn't been discovered yet. [[E - When a simulation reaches the complexity of that which it's simulating, it transcends onto the same plane of existence|When a simulation reaches the complexity of that which it's simulating, it transcends onto the same plane of existence]]. Until then, it's just a [[E - Simulations are lower resolution gestural reproductions of reality|lower resolution of reality]].

What I mean by 'hasn't been discovered yet' is, for example, the sound of a trumpet and, say, a piano combined. The fusion of those two elements and mechanical acoustics to produce that combinatory sound hasn't been made yet, but through some software that simulates trumpets and the piano, you could engineer the sound waves to produce that combination. 

It's worth noting that 'reality', in this sense, can only exist in [[D - Common Reality| common reality]] as [[E - Our mind holds only a simulation of reality| our minds are only capable of recreating a lower resolution]] of [[D - Full Reality|full reality]], and so our simulations will always exist below that threshold/ it only needs to reach [[D - Common Reality|common reality]] for us to deem it to be consistent with full reality. 

An interesting discussion is that of saliency and the feeling of it 'being real'. If the goal of a simulation was to completely reproduce, for example, some feeling or scenario in its fullest and have it's proper impacts, even if it was artificially created, if it's *just as real* as the 'real' thing, is it still a simulation?
 
What is the scope of the simulation? Does it being artificially created (and thus lacking the full 'complexity', all the 'authentic elements' of the real thing) matter if its effects are exactly the same?

If everyone was in VR and there was no difference between VR and [[D - Common Reality|common reality]] (like some Matrix situation), how might we perceive complexity and its role here?
- This question ultimately comes down to the opposite of simulation, 'reality'. 
	- What do we perceive to ultimately be 'real' and the truth? 
	- Closely related to the above, which definition of 'lower resolution' do we take? (see *[[E - Simulations are lower resolution gestural reproductions of reality|Simulations are lower resolution gestural reproductions of reality]]*).
