Functions determine how information (inputs) flows, is interpreted, and gets outputted. All functions in a system are parameters since [[E - Functional things have meaningful output|functional things have meaningful output]], and if a function is within a system, then it must affect the system or its output in some way. 

Even if the function receives an input that's meant specifically for it (i.e can only be interpreted/ converted by it), that function is *still* part of the system as this would simply outline another case of how the system operates when given this particular input. 

Put another way, [[E - Everything stands in relation to everything else|everything stands in relation to everything else]], and so a function that exists within a system will always affect the system in some way. 

You can have functions within parameters, but those are also parameters as their outputs ultimately contribute to the system's output (and defines how it works with inputs)

If [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|parameters determine how a system operates]], what about functional parameters that are redundant but are still in the system? See: [[E - All parameters are functional|all parameters are functional]]
