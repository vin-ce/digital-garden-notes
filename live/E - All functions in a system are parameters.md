All [[D - Function|functions]] in a system are [[D - Parameter|parameters]] since [[E - Functional things have meaningful output|functional things have meaningful output]]. If a function is within a system, then it must affect the system and/ or its output in some way. Put another way, [[E - Everything stands in relation to everything else|everything stands in relation to everything else]].

Functions within parameters are also parameters as their outputs ultimately contributes to how the system works with its inputs and what it outputs.

If [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|parameters determine how a system operates]], what about redundant parameters that are still in the system? See: *[[E - All parameters are functional|All parameters are functional]]*.
