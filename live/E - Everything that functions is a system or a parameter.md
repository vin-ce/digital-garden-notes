# Everything that functions is a system or a parameter

Everything that functions is either a [[D - System|system]] or a [[D - Parameter|parameter]] that operates on [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs and outputs]].

The data used to communicate between the systems/ parameters can be [[D - Element|elements]] or a [[D - Function|functions]]. Elements form units when the elements are tightly coupled through how the relate to/ worth with one another. Units are in and of themselves systems too. 

Units are never stand-alone entities that aren't either directly part of a system or a parameter: [[E - Everything stands in relation to everything else|everything stands in relation to everything else]].
