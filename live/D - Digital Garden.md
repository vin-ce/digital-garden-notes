The digital garden is an online (as of now) personal, wiki-like space of ever growing, in-process notes. It's like a blog, but far less polished, more wild and more densely tangled and inter-linked. 

Individual thoughts are the first class citizen here, and what you aim to do is to hook in as many of these atomic notes with one another as possible, hopefully overtime creating surprising and novel connections between ideas and fields.

[Joel Hook's](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) short post here describes it very well. 

For me, I first discovered it through one of the forerunners of the space, [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), who does a lot of *really* cool work on note-taking, learning and tech.
