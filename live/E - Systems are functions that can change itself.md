A function isn't necessarily a system, but a system is a [[D - Function|function]], as  [[E - Systems are ways to deal with inputs|systems are ways to deal with inputs]]. 

Systems, however, have the ability to [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion| change]] itself through the functions that it has nested within it.  

This is incredibly powerful as it provides a way for the system to fundamentally change and evolve itself, having the capacity of self-regulation and adjustment.
