A structure defines how a group of [[D - System|systems]] (or systems within a larger system) interact. It's how they organise themselves, the contexts in which [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs]] get transferred from one to another - it's the 'in betweens', the relationships. 

[[A - A City is Not a Tree|A City is Not a Tree]] contrasts two structures: [[D - Tree vs Semilattice|the tree vs the semilattice]].
