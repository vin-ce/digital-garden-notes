When thinking about how something works, we can think of it functioning in terms of its input, its outputs, and the [[D - Parameter|parameters]], which takes in the input, works on it in some way, and produces an output. 

Inputs can be thought of as arguments, outputs as what it returns.

Inputs and outputs can be anything, whether it be [[D - Element|elements]] or [[D - Function|functions]].

- **Inputs**
- Inputs can be:
	- a context, 
	- an action, 
	- an event,
	- some kind of stimulus etc

**Outputs**
- Outputs can: 
	- emit back out of the the [[D - System|system]],   
	- serve as an input into another parameter within the system (so the output becomes consumed by an input again)
	- [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|Change]] the parameter from which it was produced or any other parameter in the system that it's within (the parameter that produces such an output makes a system a system, as [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|systems can change itself]]).

Outputs can also be thought of as 'consequence'. If a function takes 5 minutes to work through an input, those 5 minutes are also part of output, alongside whatever the function produced.
