We can think about how something works in terms of its input, outputs, and [[D - Parameter|parameters]] (which takes the input and works on it to produce an output). 

In the programming sense, inputs are arguments, outputs as what it returns.

Inputs and outputs can be anything, whether they are [[D - Element|elements]] or [[D - Function|functions]].

**Inputs**
- Inputs can be:
	- a context, 
	- an action, 
	- an event,
	- some kind of stimulus etc

**Outputs**
- Outputs can: 
	- Be outputted from the [[D - System|system]].
	- Serve as an input into another parameter in system that it's currently in.
	- Feed back into the parameter that it was produced from.
	- [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|Change]] how the parameter, another parameter within the same system, or system itself [[D - Function|functions]]
		- A parameter that creates an output like this is what makes the system that it's in a system, as [[E - Systems are functions that can change itself|it enables the system to change itself]]).

- Outputs can be thought of as  'consequences'. If a function takes 5 minutes to process, those 5 minutes are also an output.
