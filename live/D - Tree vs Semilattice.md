From [[A - A City is Not a Tree|A City is Not a Tree]], there are two types of [[D - Structure|structures]]. One is the [[D - Tree|tree]] and the other is a [[D - Semilattice|semilattice]]

The primary difference between the two is complexity. 
A tree can only produce a very limited amount of subsets from its elements (so from a set of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] where you can't have a full set (as that's the system itself) or singular sets ([1], [2] etc), or empty sets ([-]), you can at most produce [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] + [3, 4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + [5, 6])

A semilattice, because it can overlap, can produce 2^(n-1) - 1 number of subsets. 
> A tree based on 20 elements can contain at most 19 further subsets of the 20, while a semilattice based on the same 20 elements can contain more than 1,000,000 different subsets.

For example:
- Another example of the fruitlessness of separation are playgrounds
	- This idea of separating recreation from everything else is ridiculous as it boxes in the notion of play inside a specific space. 
	- It's as if play doesn't occur anywhere else, indoors, by the river, etc
	- The play activities and the objects involved in it form a system
		- These systems don't exist in isolation- they overlap among themselves and also among other systems outside of play. It's multi-functional.

> Edward Banfield, in his book Political Influence, gives a detailed account of the patterns of influence and control that have actually led to decisions in Chicago. He shows that, although the lines of administrative and executive control have a formal structure which is a tree, these formal chains of influence and authority are entirely overshadowed by the ad hoc lines of control which arise naturally as each new city problem presents itself. These ad hoc lines depend on who is interested in the matter, who has what at stake, who has what favours to trade with whom.

> Nobody's sphere of influence is entirely under the control of any one superior; each person is under different influences as the problems change.
