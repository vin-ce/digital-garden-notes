There are two types of [[D - Structure|structures]]: a [[D - Tree|tree]] or a [[D - Semilattice|semilattice]]. [^From Christopher Alexander, A City is Not a Tree (ACiNaT)]:

Complexity is the primary difference.

(This image shows a tree but does correspond with my example below)

A tree can only produce a limited amount of subsets from its elements. From a set [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], you can at most produce [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] + [3, 4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + [5, 6]) (you can't have a full set (as that's the system itself), singular sets ([1], [2] etc), or empty sets ([-]),)

A semilattice, which overlaps, can produce 2^(n-1) - 1 number of subsets. 

> A tree based on 20 elements can contain at most 19 further subsets of the 20, while a semilattice based on the same 20 elements can contain more than 1,000,000 different subsets.[^ACiNaT]

A playground can demonstrate a tree-attempt to separate play from everything else. If we were to imagine that play only happens in them, it becomes ridiculous as it boxes play inside a specific space rather than happening everywhere else - on couches, by the river, in a forest etc, The play activities and the objects involved in it form a system, and these systems don't exist in isolation- they overlap among themselves and also among other systems outside of play. It's multi-functional. 

This is another fascinating example of the lack of tree-like operation in the world: 
> Edward Banfield, in his book Political Influence, gives a detailed account of the patterns of influence and control that have actually led to decisions in Chicago. He shows that, although the lines of administrative and executive control have a formal structure which is a tree, these formal chains of influence and authority are entirely overshadowed by the ad hoc lines of control which arise naturally as each new city problem presents itself. These ad hoc lines depend on who is interested in the matter, who has what at stake, who has what favours to trade with whom.

> Nobody's sphere of influence is entirely under the control of any one superior; each person is under different influences as the problems change.[^ACiNaT]
