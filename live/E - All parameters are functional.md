For a [[D - Function|function]] to be completely redundant, it must have [[E - Functions are redundant when its output has no consequence|absolutely no consequence]]. If this function on paper still exists within a system but is either never triggered or its output affects nothing else, then that function is conceptually no longer part of that system. [[E - Truly redundant things are invisible|Truly redundant things are invisible]].

Given this, as [[D - Parameter|parameters]] are functions that [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|determine how a system operates]], it must be functional as it [[E - Functional things have meaningful output|produces some output that has consequence]], whether good or bad.
