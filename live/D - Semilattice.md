> A collection of sets forms a semilattice if and only if, when two overlapping sets belong to the collection, the set of elements common to both also belongs to the collection.[^From Christopher Alexander, A City is Not a Tree]

- [234] and [345] both belong to the collection and their shared part, [34] belongs to it too.
- In terms of a city, whenever two [[D - Unit|units]] overlap, the overlapping bit is itself a unit.
- In terms of the [[A - A City is Not a Tree#Street Corner System|street corner example]]:
	- The newsrack, sidewalk and traffic light forms a unit.
		- The drugstore, entry and newsrack is also a unit
		- The overlap, the newsrack, is also in and of itself a recognisable unit
