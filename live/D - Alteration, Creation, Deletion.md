'Change' refers to three sets of actions: 
- **Alteration** is updating, fixing or even drastically changing/ reducing/ expanding. The end result still has remnants of its previous state
- **Creation** is creation of something separate, not necessarily new (can be derivative), but is distinct. 
- **Deletion** is the complete destruction and removal of something.
