Something is more static and/or restrictive if [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|given many different inputs, it only produces or allows for a certain range of outputs]]. 

The ratio of the number of inputs to the number of outputs is its 'dynamism' or 'staticism'.

A dynamic education system is where many different personalities and modes of being are encouraged and empowered to grow, develop and flourish. 100 different children all get to grow their own unique way.

A static system is where only certain types of behaviours and thoughts end up being produced. 100 different children all become doctors, like long walks on the beach and only listen to country music.

We might put these education systems on various linear graphs on how 'dynamic' they are in terms of the arts, sports, academics etc.
