Parameters are functions that can take [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs and outputs]].

[[E - All functions in a system are parameters|All functions in a system are parameters]], [[E - All parameters are functional|all parameters are functional]] and [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|parameters determine how a system operates]]. 

As parameters are functions, parameters can also be [[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output|functions can be static]]. [[E - Dynamism consists of dynamic parameters|dynamism consists of dynamic parameters]], and dynamic parameters [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|can produce different outputs given different inputs]].

A parameter which makes a [[D - System|system]] a system is one in which its output can [[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion|change]] either how the parameter itself or how other parameters in the system functions. This is incredibly powerful as it provides a way to fundamentally change and evolve itself. [[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs|A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]].

A parameter can be a [[D - System|system]].
