To determine the [[D - Dynamism|dynamism]] of something, we're questioning its ability to [[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs|produce different outputs given different inputs]]. 

[[E - All functions in a system are parameters|All functions in a system are parameters]] and [[E - Parameters determine how a system operates|parameters determine how a system operates]]. Thus, [[D - Parameter|parameters]] are what determine whether or not a system is dynamic, as how it handles its [[D - Inputs and Outputs|inputs and ouputs]] set the boundaries on what the system can do. 

However, [[E - Dynamic parts don't make a dynamic system|dynamic parts don't make a dynamic system]] - it comes down to the highest level parameters in a system. [[E - A system can be static|Systems can be static]].
