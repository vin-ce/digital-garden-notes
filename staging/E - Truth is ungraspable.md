# Truth is ungraspable

The really real and the truest truth is ungraspable by human beings. Our minds are so limited, [[E - Our mind holds only a simulation of reality|holding but a simulation of reality]], as is the limited ability of our [[Nature of Thoughts MOC#Low-Res Simulations|thoughts and concepts]]. It makes sense that the most profound experiences (e.g psychedelic, spiritual etc) are totally ineffable.
