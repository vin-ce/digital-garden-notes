The capabilities of the computational medium allows for creations of [[D - Simulation|simulated]] worlds, and its particular [[E - The power of the computational medium comes from its ability to read and write dynamic systems|power stemming from its capability to read + write dynamic systems]]. This makes it a [[E - The computational medium is a meta-medium|meta-medium]]. 

Some current examples may be hyper-focused social ones (the social medias) or video games (which can be seen as 'native' to the computer).

From [[A - Chatting with Glue]], I've also imagined the possibility of somehow actively participating in a conversation that has already past, perhaps by extending various points of it in meaningful ways - a greater version of a forum discussion.
