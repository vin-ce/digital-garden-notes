# Accidental vs Absolute Reality

There are two kinds of reality (according to [[Kosho Uchiyama]] in Opening the Hand of Thought):

## Accidental/ Chance
- I'm pouring myself tea. No absolute reason why I have to be sitting here doing this, it's an accidental reality. I just happen to be doing so. Our of all the variations of possible actions, I happen to be taking this one.
- Me being born in a certain country, in a certain time period, to certain parents etc

## Absolute/ Undeniable 
- Things that occur in all versions and permutations
- That which don't change with any amount of resistance, opposition, denial.
- An undeniable reality is that all living things die
