# SPIO Model MOC
## Systems, Parameters, Inputs + Outputs

[[SPIO Workbench of Ideas]]


**core definitions**
[[D - System]]
[[D - Parameter]]
[[D - Inputs and Outputs]]

[[D - Element]]
[[D - Function]]

[[E - Everything that functions is a system or a parameter]]
[[E - Systems are functions that can change itself]]
[[E - All functions in a system are parameters]]

**additional elements**
[[D - Unit]]
[[D - Structure]]
[[D - Tree]]
[[D - Semilattice]]

[[D - Tree vs Semilattice]]

**dynamic**
[[D - Dynamism]]

[[E - For it to be dynamic, different inputs can produce different outputs]]
[[E - Parameters determine dynamism]]
[[E - Dynamism consists of dynamic parameters]]
[[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]]

[[D - Alteration, Creation, Deletion]]

**static**
[[E - A function is static if given all possible inputs, it always produces the same output]]
[[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output]]
[[E - A system can be static]]
[[E - Cyclical things are static]]
[[E - Dynamic parts don't make a dynamic system]]
[[E - Being static is not necessarily bad]]

**functioning / redundancy**
[[E - Functions are redundant when its output has no consequence]]
[[E - Truly redundant things are invisible]]
[[E - Functional things have meaningful output]]
[[E - All parameters are functional]]

**misc**
[[E - Systems are ways to deal with inputs]]
