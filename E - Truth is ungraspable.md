The really real and the truest truth is ungraspable by human beings. Our minds are limited, [[E - Our mind holds only a simulation of reality|holding but a simulation of reality]], capable of only producing [[Nature of Thoughts MOC#Low-Res Simulations|low-res thoughts and concepts]]. 

It makes sense that the most profound experiences (e.g psychedelic, spiritual etc) are totally ineffable.
