[[D - Simulation|Simulations]] are, by definition, recreations of some [[D - Inputs and Outputs|input]] reality. 

They seek to reproduce the real thing as much as possible, but are 'lower resolution' because they lack, on a fundamental level, something that the real thing has.

Think of how computers are often attempting to 'simulate' something, whether it be conversations, paper or scenarios and situations. In our current state, we are unable to completely recreate reality in all its complexity on a computer, and so it stays as a lower res 'mock'. However, various features of it are computer-specific, for example a web browser isn't a 'simulation' of anything[^Parts of it could be, like the bookmark, but the browser in its entirety becomes its own thing].

It becomes real (no longer a simulation) when [[E - When a simulation reaches the complexity of that which it's simulating, it transcends onto the same plane of existence|all of its elements and complexity are at play]], or when we can no longer differentiate between the real and the simulated (see *[[D - Simulation|Simulation]]* for more discussion).
