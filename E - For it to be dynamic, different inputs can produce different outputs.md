Something [[D - Dynamism|dynamic]] produces different [[D - Inputs and Outputs|outputs]] given different inputs. As I think of dynamism/ staticism in terms of [[E - Restriction and staticism is the ratio of input to output|ratios]], not all inputs have to produce a different output. 

See also the discussion in *[[E - A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs|A dynamic system can be one where it's able to change its outputs]]*.

Let's think of a pen, which we usually see as static. The pen is dynamic if, depending on the context (where it's drawing, what it's drawing on, who's holding it etc), the ink or colour or material that it produces is different. We might think of a dynamic pen that can draw on *any* surface because it's able to switch the ink it uses based on the surface.

We can also think of the degree of dynamism. A paper warps in response to the pen because of the material interaction between it and the ink. What if it can change its own texture completely based on pressure or colour?
