The digital garden is a personal, wiki-like space collecting ever growing, in-process notes. It's like a far less polished blog - more wild, densely tangled and interlinked. 

I am to hook as many of these atomic notes with one another as possible, creating surprising and novel connections between ideas and fields overtime.

[Joel Hook's](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) short post describes it well. 

I first discovered it through one of the forerunners of the space, [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), who does brilliant work on note-taking, learning and tech. 

Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), Nick Milo's [LYT system](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/_START+HERE) and incorporating a [spaced repetition system](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) with Anki has, dare I say, changed my life. It enables me take notes that generate (by orders of magnitude) richer and deeper ideas, questions, and comprehension than ever before. I also have a system that I can trust on for hopefully years, if not decades.

This digital garden shows a section of that output.

If you'd like more resources on note-taking, look at this [small Notion resource page](https://www.notion.so/Research-Note-Taking-b3a8299501ef43cb958cd9c69809bb93) I made. It'll hopefully give you some ideas and ways forward for deeper investigation.
